Phrase Hunter is a console based application. The goal is for the user to complete the phrase by guessing one letter at time. 
The rules are essentially the same as hangman. User's guesses are displayed, they are notified if they have, guessed a letter
before, or if the letter they guess is incorrect. Users lose if they guess more than five incorrect guesses. Download the project
and play in your favorite IDE!
